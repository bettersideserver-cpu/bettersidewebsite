You are a senior React + CSS UI developer.

I want you to build ONLY the **homepage** for my product called **BetterSide**.

I will upload my own logo and hero background image later. For now, use placeholders but structure the layout EXACTLY like this style:
- sandboxvr.com hero section + “Discover our worlds” row + video section.

Tech:
- Use React.
- Use modern, clean CSS (CSS modules or a single CSS file). Tailwind is okay if you prefer, but keep classes readable.
- Make it fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Brand:
- This is for a real estate immersive experience platform (IPX).
- The logo colors are blue and orange. Use:
  - Primary: #0057FF (blue)
  - Accent: #FF6A00 (orange)
  - Background: #050816 to #0B0F1A dark gradient OR very dark navy.
- Lots of contrast, cinematic feel, rounded buttons, smooth hover effects.

PAGE STRUCTURE (top to bottom):

1) HERO SECTION (full screen height)
-----------------------------------
- Full-bleed hero section (100vh) with a large background image.
  - For now use a placeholder image like `hero-project.jpg`.
- NO separate top bar. The navbar should be **overlaid** on top of the hero image, like Sandbox VR.
- Top-left: BetterSide logo (use placeholder `betterside-logo.png`).
- Top-right: navigation links in a single row:
  - “For Developers”
  - “For Channel Partners”
  - “For Home Buyers”
  - “About”
  - A pill-shaped button: “Login”
- Centered vertically (or slightly lower than center) add:
  - Small label text above headline: “IMMERSIVE PROJECT EXPERIENCE (IPX)”
  - Big bold headline: “Experience Real Estate Before It’s Built.”
  - Short subheading: something like
    “BetterSide helps you explore trusted pre-launch and under-construction projects in full immersive 3D.”
  - Primary CTA button: “Explore IPX Projects”
  - Secondary CTA button (outline style): “Talk to Our Team”
- At the very bottom of the hero, add:
  - A subtle gradient fade into the next section.
  - Small slider-style dots (3–4) to suggest there can be multiple hero slides (like Sandbox VR). Only the first needs to be “active”; no real slider logic needed yet.

2) “DISCOVER PROJECTS” HORIZONTAL CARDS SECTION
-----------------------------------------------
- Dark background (#050816 or similar) continuing from hero, with some spacing.
- Section title centered at top: “DISCOVER OUR PROJECT WORLDS”
  - Smaller subtitle below: “Handpicked IPX experiences from trusted developers.”
- Under the title, a horizontally scrollable row of **large project cards**, similar to the “Discover our worlds” section of Sandbox VR:
  - Each card:
    - Big thumbnail image (placeholder, e.g. `project1.jpg`) with rounded corners and a soft shadow.
    - On the image, small corner labels such as:
      - Top-left: “NEW”, “BEST SELLER”, “PRE-LAUNCH” (use blue or orange badges).
    - Below the image:
      - Project Title (e.g. “Skyline Heights, Zirakpur”).
      - Smaller text line: “Luxury 3 & 4 BHK • Trusted Developer”.
  - Make 4–6 mock project cards.
  - Cards should be in a horizontally scrollable container with smooth scrolling and visible partial next card on desktop (like a carousel strip), but no complex slider needed; just overflow-x scroll.

3) FEATURED VIDEO / BIG THUMBNAIL SECTION
-----------------------------------------
- Next section: a full-width “featured project” block, similar to the Sandbox VR video area.
- Layout:
  - Large 16:9 video-style container centered on page with rounded corners.
  - Use a dark overlay and big **play button** in the center (blue circular button).
  - Background is a still image placeholder like `featured-project.jpg`.
- Below (or overlaid at the bottom of the video frame) add:
  - Project name in bold.
  - One line of description (e.g. “Full immersive tour of Lakeside Residences, pre-launch in Mohali.”).
- Under the video, centered buttons:
  - Solid blue button: “View Full IPX Experience”
  - Outline button: “Connect with a Channel Partner”
- Under the buttons, add a subtle small text line: “Powered by BetterSide — only verified developers listed.”

GENERAL STYLING GUIDELINES
--------------------------
- Use the blue (#0057FF) and orange (#FF6A00) with dark backgrounds and white text.
- Buttons:
  - Primary: blue background, white text, slightly rounded (24px radius), box-shadow, hover = slightly lighter blue + raise effect.
  - Secondary: transparent with white border or blue border, white text, hover = subtle background tint.
- Typography:
  - Hero heading: large, bold, clean sans-serif.
  - Body text: slightly smaller, high readability, line-height relaxed.
- Use spacing and padding so that everything feels premium and cinematic, not cramped.
- Add smooth hover effects to project cards (slight scale up and shadow).

ROUTING / STRUCTURE
-------------------
- Create a single React component called `HomePage` that includes:
  - HeroSection
  - DiscoverProjectsSection
  - FeaturedVideoSection
- Export `HomePage` as default and render it in the root App component.
- Use static mock data for project names, tags, etc.

Deliverable:
- A working React project with this single homepage view.
- Clean, well-structured JSX and CSS so I can later plug in real images and copy.
