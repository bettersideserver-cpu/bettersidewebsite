I want to add strong front-end validation to ALL three signup flows:

- Channel Partner form
- Home Buyer / Investor form
- Developer form

Right now any random text is accepted (wrong phone, invalid email, fake RERA, etc.).
I want the forms to block obviously invalid inputs and show clear error messages.

IMPORTANT: 
- Do NOT connect to external APIs.
- We only validate FORMAT and required fields, not real government records.
- Do NOT change navigation or routing, only add form validation logic + inline error messages.

-----------------------------
GENERAL BEHAVIOR FOR ALL FORMS
-----------------------------
For each form:

1. Use React state to store both:
   - form values
   - error messages per field (e.g. `errors.fullName`, `errors.phone`, etc).

2. On submit:
   - Run a `validate()` function that checks all fields.
   - If any field is invalid:
     - Set error messages.
     - PREVENT submit (do not proceed to dashboard / redirect).
   - Only if there are no errors:
     - Clear errors.
     - Proceed with existing logic (store in localStorage, redirect, etc.).

3. Display error messages:
   - Under each field show a small red text if that field has an error.
   - Example: `<p className="error-text">Please enter a valid 10-digit phone number.</p>`
   - Use a consistent style (red text, small font) for all forms.

-----------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
-----------------------------------
- Keep all existing styling and layout.
- Only add error states and validation logic.
- Disable the submit button OR prevent submit in `onSubmit` until no errors.
- You can implement one shared `validateEmail` and `validatePhone` helper used by multiple forms.
- Do not break existing redirects (CP → /cp-dashboard, Developer → /developer-dashboard, Buyer → /).
- Do not alter the dashboards; this task is only about the three signup forms.

After this change:
- If I enter "abc" as email or "12345" as phone, the form should NOT submit and should show clear red error messages.
- Only properly formatted values should allow moving into the admin dashboards or homepage.
