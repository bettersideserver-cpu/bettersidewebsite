Fix this bug in the Channel Partner flow:

When a user signs up as a Channel Partner, they enter their real details (name, company, phone, email, city) — but inside the CP Dashboard the dummy profile ("Welcome back, John!" and "John Doe / Apex Realty") is still visible.

I want the CP dashboard to show the REAL information entered in the signup form.

Required:

1) In the CP signup submit handler:
   — After form validation and before redirect, save all CP details to localStorage:
      localStorage.setItem("userRole", "cp");
      localStorage.setItem("userName", fullNameFromForm);
      localStorage.setItem("userCompany", companyNameFromForm);
      localStorage.setItem("userPhone", phoneFromForm);
      localStorage.setItem("userEmail", emailFromForm);
      localStorage.setItem("userCity", cityFromForm);

2) In the CP Admin Panel layout:
   — Remove any hardcoded mock names like "John", "John Doe", "Apex Realty".
   — Read these values instead:
      const userName = localStorage.getItem("userName") || "Channel Partner";
      const userCompany = localStorage.getItem("userCompany") || "";
      const userCity = localStorage.getItem("userCity") || "";

   — Change the greeting title from:
      Welcome back, John!
     to:
      Welcome back, {userName}!

   — In the sidebar profile section, display:
      {userName}
      {userCompany} (second line)
      Optionally city in small text if available

3) If the CP profile avatar shows initials like "JD", generate initials dynamically from userName.
   If initials cannot be generated, fallback to "CP".

4) Do NOT change anything in the Developer dashboard or Buyer flow.
   Only update the Channel Partner logic.

5) Ensure the logout button clears all CP localStorage items:
   userRole
   userName
   userCompany
   userPhone
   userEmail
   userCity

   then redirect to "/".

After this fix, when I sign up with:
Name = Manik Sharma
Company = Skillto Realty
City = Mohali
The CP dashboard should show:
"Welcome back, Manik Sharma!"
and sidebar should show:
"Manik Sharma"
"Skillto Realty"
