I want to add a very clear **Home button** to BOTH admin panels:

- Channel Partner (CP) Admin Panel
- Developer Admin Panel

Right now, the user can only go back to the homepage by clicking on the BetterSide logo, which is not obvious. I want a dedicated Home button.

Please do the following:

1) In the GLOBAL NAVBAR (the one that appears at the top for all pages when logged in):
   - Add a visible text link or button labeled **"Home"**.
   - Place it in the main navigation area (for example, next to "Explore Projects" or before any dashboard links).
   - When clicked, it should navigate to the `/` route (homepage) using React Router (`useNavigate` or `<Link to="/" />`).
   - Keep the BetterSide logo behavior as it is (still clickable to home), but the new Home link must be clearly visible.

2) Inside the CP Admin Panel layout:
   - At the top of the main content area (near the page title or top bar), add a small secondary button or text link labeled **"Back to Home"** or just **"Home"**.
   - This must navigate to `/` (homepage) without breaking the CP dashboard state.
   - Use a subtle but visible style (e.g., outline button or a simple text link with an icon).
   - Do NOT remove or change the sidebar items (Dashboard, Leads, Run Ads, Marketing Support, Profile).

3) Inside the Developer Admin Panel layout:
   - Same behavior: at the top of the main content area, add a **"Back to Home"** or **"Home"** button/link.
   - It should navigate to `/` using React Router.
   - Styling should match or be similar to the CP panel Home button, so the UI feels consistent.
   - Keep all existing tabs (Dashboard, Projects, Channel Partners, Invite CPs, Marketing & Ads, Profile) unchanged.

4) Make sure:
   - No new routes are created. The Home button should simply reuse the existing `/` route.
   - No 404s are introduced.
   - The addition should NOT break existing role-based behavior:
     - CP can still go to `/cp-dashboard`.
     - Developer can still go to `/developer-dashboard`.
     - Home button is just an extra quick access.

5) Do not change:
   - Login/signup flow.
   - Role handling in localStorage.
   - Any of the existing dashboard content.

Just add the Home button/link in navbar + a small Home/Back to Home control inside both admin layouts as described.
