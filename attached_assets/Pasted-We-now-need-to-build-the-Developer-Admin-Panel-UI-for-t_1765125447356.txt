We now need to build the **Developer Admin Panel UI** for the Developer role.

Important:
- Do NOT change the CP Admin Panel or homepage.
- This task is only to build the Developer Panel UI (front-end only, no backend).
- All data can be mock / static for now.

Create a new component/layout called `DeveloperDashboardLayout` (or similar) that loads when the route `/developer-dashboard` is opened.

Styling:
- Use the same color theme as the CP panel (dark background, blue + orange accents).
- Sidebar navigation with the following items:
  1. Dashboard (default)
  2. Projects
  3. Channel Partners
  4. Invite CPs
  5. Marketing & Ads
  6. Profile

Panel structure:
- It should behave exactly like the CP Admin Panel:
  - All tabs load inside the same layout (no routing to subpages)
  - Use a `useState` variable such as `activeTab` to switch content
  - Clicking a sidebar item only changes `activeTab`, not the URL
  - Do not cause any 404 errors

---------------------------------------
TAB CONTENT (with mock data)
---------------------------------------

1) **Dashboard (default tab)**
Show high-level project summary for the developer using mock data. Example table or cards for each project:
- Project name (e.g. Lutyens, California State)
- Number of CPs working on that project
- Number of CPs who have run ads for that project
- Total leads generated (summary count, not individual leads)
- Status (e.g., Active)

2) **Projects tab**
List all projects in a table or card layout. Each entry contains:
- Project name
- City / Location
- Number of CPs attached
- Number of CPs running ads
- Total leads
- A button like “View Details” (this can simply open a placeholder modal or expand panel with mock CP list inside it)

For project detail, mock view:
- List of CPs working on that project
- Show columns:
  - CP Name
  - Company Name
  - Total leads for the project (summary only)
  - Has run ads? (Yes/No indicator)
- Use mock static values.

3) **Channel Partners tab**
Table of all CPs working with the developer across all projects (mock data).
Columns:
- CP Name
- Company
- City
- Number of projects assigned
- Total leads generated (summary only)

4) **Invite CPs tab**
Two ways to add CP:

A) Send an invite (form fields):
- CP Name
- Company Name
- Phone
- Email
- Dropdown: select project(s) to associate CP with
- Submit button (front-end only)

B) Generate sharable “White Link” for each project:
- Show a small list of developer’s projects with a copyable share link (use dummy placeholder URL values for now, e.g., `https://betterside.com/invite/lutyens/ABC123`)
- When a CP signs up using this link in the future, they should be assigned to that project (for now, just mock the UI)

5) **Marketing & Ads tab**
Show how many creatives + EDMs BetterSide has provided to CPs (counts only).
- Top summary cards:
  - Creatives provided today
  - Creatives this month
  - Total creatives
  - Total EDMs
- Then a table:
  - Date, Type (Creative/EDM), Project, Count
- Use mock data.

6) **Profile tab**
A simple placeholder showing developer information from mock data:
- Developer/Group Name
- Contact Person Name
- Phone
- Email
- City
- RERA Registered: Yes/No
- GST Number

Add a “Coming Soon: Edit Profile” note.

---------------------------------------
NAVIGATION & RULES
---------------------------------------

- Make `/developer-dashboard` show this panel.
- Sidebar should highlight active tab.
- Clicking the BetterSide **logo** should always return to `/` (homepage).
- Navbar should show:
  - “Hi, {developerName}”
  - A link to “Developer Dashboard”
  - Logout button
- Do NOT break CP dashboard or Buyer experience.

---------------------------------------
FINAL NOTES
---------------------------------------
- Deliver fully running UI with mock data.
- No backend, no database, no file upload.
- The purpose of this step is UI structure only.
