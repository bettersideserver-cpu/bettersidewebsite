We already have a working homepage and a working CP Admin Panel.

Now I want to upgrade the login/signup flow with proper data collection and role-based redirects.

TASK:

1) When a user clicks "Login", instead of the dummy login, show:
   Step 1 — "Who are you?"
   Options:
   - Channel Partner
   - Home Buyer / Investor
   - Developer

   Use radio buttons or a dropdown.

2) After choosing a role -> show a role-specific signup form:

   For Channel Partner:
   - Full Name
   - Phone
   - Email
   - Company / Firm Name
   - City
   - Submit button

   For Home Buyer / Investor:
   - Full Name
   - Phone
   - Email
   - City
   - (optional) Budget
   - Submit button

   For Developer:
   - Developer / Group Name
   - Contact Person Name
   - Phone
   - Email
   - City
   - GST Number
   - RERA Registration Number
   - Toggle for “Are you RERA Registered?”
   - (optional) Text field to paste link to documents
   - Submit button

3) After submit, save user info to localStorage:
   - userName
   - userRole (cp / buyer / developer)

4) Redirect based on role:
   - If Channel Partner -> `/cp-dashboard`
   - If Home Buyer / Investor -> `/` (homepage)
   - If Developer -> `/developer-dashboard` (create a blank placeholder page for now)

5) Navbar update:
   - Replace the Login button with text like: “Hi, {userName}”
   - If userRole is “cp”, show a “CP Dashboard” navbar link
   - If userRole is “developer”, show a “Developer Dashboard” navbar link
   - If userRole is “buyer”, no dashboard link
   - Add a “Logout” button that clears localStorage and returns to homepage

6) From the CP Dashboard and Developer Dashboard pages:
   - Clicking the BetterSide logo in navbar should take user to `/`
   - Dashboard navigation links should still work normally

7) Do NOT modify the existing CP Dashboard content or layout.
   Just connect the login and role redirect.

8) Create a temporary placeholder `DeveloperDashboard` component rendered at `/developer-dashboard` that only shows:
   “Welcome Developer, Developer Dashboard coming soon.”

Once done, everything should run without breaking the existing UI or logic.
