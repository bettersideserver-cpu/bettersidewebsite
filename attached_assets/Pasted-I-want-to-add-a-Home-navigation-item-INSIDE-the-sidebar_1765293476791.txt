I want to add a "Home" navigation item INSIDE the sidebars of both admin panels (CP and Developer).

Right now the CP sidebar items are:
- Dashboard
- Leads
- Run Ads
- Marketing Support
- Profile

And the Developer sidebar items are:
- Dashboard
- Projects
- Channel Partners
- Invite CPs
- Marketing & Ads
- Profile

Please update the code as follows:

1) CHANNEL PARTNER PANEL SIDEBAR
--------------------------------
- In the CP admin layout component (the one that renders the CP sidebar and uses `activeTab` to switch between Dashboard, Leads, etc.):
  - Add a new sidebar item labeled **"Home"** with a home icon, consistent style with the others.
  - Place it at the TOP of the list (above Dashboard) OR just below the logo — whichever is easier to implement cleanly.
  - When "Home" is clicked:
    - Use React Router to navigate to `/` (the public homepage).
    - It should NOT change the `activeTab` state or try to render content inside the panel; it simply redirects to `/`.

- Do NOT add a new tab/content section for "Home" in the CP panel; it’s just a shortcut out of the panel to the main site.

2) DEVELOPER PANEL SIDEBAR
---------------------------
- In the Developer admin layout component (the one with Dashboard / Projects / Channel Partners / etc.):
  - Add the same type of **"Home"** item to its sidebar.
  - Place in a similar position (top of the list under the logo or just above Dashboard).
  - On click, navigate to `/` (homepage) using React Router.
  - Again, do NOT add an `activeTab` for Home; it should not render content inside the developer panel, only redirect out.

3) STYLING & BEHAVIOR
----------------------
- The "Home" item should visually match the other sidebar items (icon + label, hover state, etc.).
- It should NOT be highlighted as an "active tab" after navigation, because once the user is on `/`, they are no longer inside the admin layout.
- Do not remove or rename any existing sidebar items (Dashboard, Leads, etc.).

4) DO NOT CHANGE:
-----------------
- Existing homepage
- Login / role logic
- CP and Developer dashboard content
- Top navbar behavior

Just update the sidebars to include a working "Home" item that redirects to `/`.
