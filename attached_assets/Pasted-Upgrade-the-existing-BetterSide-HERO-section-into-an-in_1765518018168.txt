Upgrade the existing BetterSide HERO section into an interactive, high-performance hero using React + modern CSS/JS. Keep the current layout, brand colors (#0057FF blue, #FF6A00 orange) and logo placeholder. Implement the following interactive features and fallbacks:

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use React functional components. Keep code modular (e.g., Hero, ParallaxLayer, Particles, CTAButton).
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` setting and disable non-essential animations in that case.
- Ensure mobile performance: disable mouse-parallax and particle canvas on small screens (< 768px). Use simple scroll parallax only.
- No external heavy libraries unless necessary; lightweight libs like GSAP are allowed but avoid bloated dependencies.
- Add comments explaining key logic and where to tune values.

INTERACTIVE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1) Parallax on scroll
- The background image has a gentle vertical parallax as the user scrolls down.
- Implement using `window.requestAnimationFrame` + transform (translateY) for smoothness or use CSS `transform` driven by IntersectionObserver.

2) Mouse-move parallax layers (desktop only)
- Split hero visuals into three layers: background, mid-layer (decorative shapes), and foreground card (headline & CTAs).
- On mouse move, move layers with different intensities:
  - background: translateX/Y by 2-6px
  - mid-layer: 6-12px
  - foreground: 2-4px (subtle)
- Apply `transform: translate3d(...)` for GPU acceleration.
- Throttle mouse events to 60fps using `requestAnimationFrame`.

3) Floating particles (optional lightweight canvas)
- A small particle field (20–40 dots) drifting slowly behind content.
- Use HTML5 canvas simple loop; on mobile disable or reduce to 6–8 particles.
- Particles should be subtle, low-contrast, and not interfere with readability.

4) Hero content reveal and micro animations
- Headline and subheading should fade+slide up on mount (`opacity` + `translateY`).
- CTA buttons appear with small stagger (0.1–0.15s delay).
- Button hover: scale 1.03 with soft shadow; click creates a small ripple effect.

5) Interactive CTA behavior
- Primary CTA ("Explore IPX Projects") should show a 2-step micro-interaction:
  - Hover: glow/outline animation using CSS variables.
  - Click: animate a subtle transform and then call a placeholder callback (e.g., `onExploreClick()`).
- Secondary CTA ("Talk to Our Team") should have an outline style and a subtle border animation on hover.

6) Accessibility
- Add `aria-label` for CTAs.
- Make hero keyboard-navigable.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and `prefers-contrast`.

7) Performance & fallback
- Lazy-load hero background image (use `loading="lazy"` or IntersectionObserver).
- If `window.matchMedia('(max-width: 767px)')` is true, disable mouse parallax and particles.
- Use CSS variables for tuning motion intensity.

DELIVERABLES:
- A React component `InteractiveHero.jsx` (or .tsx) plus CSS (or module) and a small `particles.js` helper if needed.
- Example usage in `HomePage` replacing the old hero.
- Tunable variables at the top of the component (particleCount, parallaxIntensity, mouseMoveFactor).
- Comments telling where to change colors, durations, and particle counts.
- Do not touch backend or routing.

Note: keep the hero visually identical to our current design (logo on top-left, nav overlaid, centered headline/subheading, two CTAs), but with the described interactivity layered in. Provide a short README comment in the component describing how to disable/adjust animations.
