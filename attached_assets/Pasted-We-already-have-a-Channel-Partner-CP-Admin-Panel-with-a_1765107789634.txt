We already have a Channel Partner (CP) Admin Panel with a sidebar and a working Dashboard tab, but when I click the other sidebar items (Leads, Run Ads, Marketing Support, Profile) I get a 404 page.

Please fix this by turning the CP Panel into a SINGLE page with internal tab switching, instead of separate routes.

Steps:

1) Find the CP Admin Panel component
   - It might be named something like `CpAdminLayout`, `CpPanel`, or `CpDashboard`.
   - This is the component that shows the sidebar with:
     - Dashboard
     - Leads
     - Run Ads
     - Marketing Support
     - Profile

2) Remove routing-based navigation from the sidebar
   - If the sidebar items are using `<Link>` or `<NavLink>` that change the URL (e.g. `/cp-dashboard/leads`, `/cp-dashboard/run-ads`, etc.), change them to simple `button` or `div` with `onClick`.
   - Do NOT navigate to a new route when clicking sidebar items.
   - Instead, clicking a sidebar item should just change local component state, e.g. `activeTab`.

3) Add local state for active tab
   - Inside the main CP panel component, add something like:

     ```tsx
     const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<"dashboard" | "leads" | "runAds" | "marketing" | "profile">("dashboard");
     ```

   - For each sidebar item:
     - `Dashboard` → `setActiveTab("dashboard")`
     - `Leads` → `setActiveTab("leads")`
     - `Run Ads` → `setActiveTab("runAds")`
     - `Marketing Support` → `setActiveTab("marketing")`
     - `Profile` → `setActiveTab("profile")`
   - Apply an “active” CSS style based on `activeTab` so the selected tab is highlighted (like it already is for Dashboard).

4) Conditionally render the main content by `activeTab`

   - Keep the existing Dashboard UI inside:

     ```tsx
     {activeTab === "dashboard" && (
       // existing dashboard JSX here
     )}
     ```

   - Create simple content for the other tabs using our requirements. Use mock data.

   **Leads tab (`activeTab === "leads"`):**
   - Show a full leads table with columns:
     - Name, Phone, Project, Source, Date, Status, Notes.
   - Status should be a dropdown with:
     - "New", "Called – No Answer", "Called – Interested", "Called – Not Interested", "Follow-up".
   - Add simple mock rows for 5–10 leads.

   **Run Ads tab (`activeTab === "runAds"`):**
   - Show a card titled “Run Ads with BetterSide”.
   - Inside, a simple form with fields:
     - Project (dropdown with 3 mock projects)
     - City / Area (text input)
     - Objective (dropdown: "Lead Generation", "Awareness", "Site Visits")
     - Budget in INR (number input)
     - Duration in days (number input)
     - Additional Notes (textarea)
   - A primary button: “Submit Ad Request”.
   - Below the form, a table titled “Your Ad Requests” with columns:
     - Project, Objective, Budget, Duration, Status, Impressions, Clicks, Leads
     - Fill with 3–4 mock entries.

   **Marketing Support tab (`activeTab === "marketing"`):**
   - Top row of 4 summary cards:
     - “Creatives received today”
     - “Creatives this month”
     - “Total creatives”
     - “Total EDMs sent”
   - Below that, a table with columns:
     - Date, Type (Creative / EDM), Project, Count
   - Add a small note at the top:
     - “Actual creatives and EDMs are shared via WhatsApp or email. This page only tracks counts.”

   **Profile tab (`activeTab === "profile"`):**
   - Simple card showing mock CP details:
     - Name, Agency Name, Phone, Email, City.
   - A “Coming Soon” note for editing profile later.

5) Make sure:
   - No 404 page is shown when clicking any of the 5 sidebar items.
   - The URL stays the same (e.g. `/cp-dashboard`) while switching tabs.
   - Overall styling matches the existing Dashboard design (dark theme, blue highlight, rounded cards).

Do not change the homepage or global routing. Only update the CP Admin Panel component and its sidebar/tab behavior.
