You previously created a React homepage for BetterSide.  
Now I want you to add a **Channel Partner (CP) Admin Panel** section.

Tech:
- Use React.
- Keep styling consistent with the existing BetterSide theme (dark background, blue + orange accents, white text).
- Focus on very simple, clear UI. CPs are not very tech-savvy.

Create a new layout for the CP Admin Panel with:
- A left sidebar menu.
- Main content area on the right.

Sidebar items (in this order):
1. Dashboard
2. Leads
3. Run Ads with BetterSide
4. Marketing Support
5. Profile (placeholder for now)

### 1) CP Dashboard

When the CP logs in (assume we route them to `/cp-dashboard`), show:

- Top section with 3–4 summary cards:
  - “Today’s Leads”
  - “Total Leads”
  - “Active Projects”
  - “Ad Requests in Progress”

Use mock numbers for now.

- Below the summary cards, show:
  - A leads table **for today’s leads only** with columns:
    - Name
    - Phone
    - Project
    - Source (e.g. “Meta Ads”, “Organic”, “BetterSide IPX”)
    - Date/Time
    - Status (dropdown)
  - The **Status** dropdown should include:
    - “New”
    - “Called – No Answer”
    - “Called – Interested”
    - “Called – Not Interested”
    - “Follow-up”
  - Optional: a small “Notes” icon or button opening a simple notes text area inside the row.

- At the bottom or side of the dashboard, add a large prominent button:
  - Label: “Run Ads with BetterSide”
  - Clicking it should navigate to the “Run Ads with BetterSide” section (see below).

### 2) Leads Page

A separate page showing **all leads**, not just today.

- Table columns:
  - Name
  - Phone
  - Project
  - Source
  - Date
  - Status (dropdown with same statuses as above)
  - Notes (simple text area or icon to open a notes modal)

- Above the table, add filters:
  - Project (dropdown)
  - Status (dropdown)
  - Date range (from–to, even if it’s just UI for now)

- All data can be mock data stored in a JS array; no backend needed yet.

### 3) “Run Ads with BetterSide” Page

This should NOT let the CP build the ad campaign directly.  
Instead, it should show a **simple form** that sends an ad request to the BetterSide team.

Form fields:
- Project (dropdown of mock projects that CP has access to)
- City / Area (text input)
- Objective (dropdown with:
  - “Lead Generation”
  - “Awareness”
  - “Site Visits”
  )
- Budget (number input, label in INR)
- Duration (number + “days” or start and end date inputs)
- Additional Notes (textarea)

At the bottom:
- Primary button: “Submit Ad Request”

Below the form:
- A table or list titled “Your Ad Requests” with columns:
  - Project
  - Objective
  - Budget
  - Duration
  - Status (Requested / In Discussion / Running / Completed)
  - Basic stats columns (use mock numbers):
    - Impressions
    - Clicks
    - Leads

All data can be static mock data; just build the UI and component structure.

### 4) Marketing Support Page

This page DOES NOT store actual creatives or EDM files.  
It only shows **numbers** to the CP, so they can see how much support they’ve received.

Layout:

- Top summary cards:
  - “Creatives received today”
  - “Creatives this month”
  - “Total creatives so far”
  - “Total EDMs sent”

Use mock numbers.

- Below, a simple table with columns:
  - Date
  - Type (Creative / EDM)
  - Project
  - Count (how many pieces sent that day, e.g. 3)

All data static/mock.

Include a small text note at the top of the page:  
“Actual creatives and EDMs are shared with you via WhatsApp or email. This page only tracks the count.”

### 5) Profile Page

Simple placeholder:
- Show CP name, phone, email, company name (mock).
- A “Coming soon” text for editing profile.

### General UI Requirements

- Use the same overall theme as the homepage:
  - Dark background shades.
  - Blue (#0057FF) as primary, orange (#FF6A00) as accent.
  - White text for headings, light gray text for secondary.
- Use cards with rounded corners and subtle shadows for summary boxes.
- Tables should be clean and easy to read with row hover highlights.
- Make sure navigation between sections works using React state or a simple router.
- No WhatsApp integration, no chat windows, no external APIs are required.
- Everything can be front-end only with mock data.

Finally:
- Export this CP Admin Panel as a main component (e.g., `CpAdminLayout`) and wire it into the app so it can be rendered at a route like `/cp-dashboard`.
