We already have:
- A React homepage for BetterSide.
- A Channel Partner Admin Panel component (e.g. CpAdminLayout or CpDashboard) that you created earlier.

Now I want you to CONNECT everything with proper routing and a simple role-based login flow.

1) Add React Router (if not already added)
------------------------------------------
- Use BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route from `react-router-dom`.
- In `App.jsx` (or main App file):
  - Wrap the app with `<BrowserRouter>`.
  - Create routes for:
    - `/` → BetterSide HomePage
    - `/cp-dashboard` → CP Admin Panel component (CpAdminLayout or whatever you named it earlier)
- Make sure the existing homepage continues to render at `/`.

2) Update the Login component
-----------------------------
I want the login / signup UI to ask the user **who they are**.

- In the login form component:
  - Add a field: "Who are you?" with options (radio buttons or a dropdown):
    - "Channel Partner"
    - "Home Buyer"
    - "Developer"
  - Store the selected role in React state (e.g. `selectedRole`).
  - On successful submit (for now, no real auth; just simulate):
    - If `selectedRole === "Channel Partner"`:
      - Save the role in `localStorage` (e.g. `userRole = "cp"`).
      - Navigate to `/cp-dashboard`.
    - Otherwise:
      - Save role in `localStorage` (e.g. `userRole = "buyer"` or `"developer"`).
      - Navigate to `/` (homepage).

You can use `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` to handle navigation.

3) Navbar: show CP dashboard link only for CPs
----------------------------------------------
- In the main navbar component:
  - Make the **logo** clickable and navigate to `/`.
  - Change the menu items as we already did earlier (Explore Projects, How BetterSide Works, Trusted Developers, About).
  - Add a new menu item **only if the user role is "cp"**:
    - Label: `CP Dashboard`
    - On click, navigate to `/cp-dashboard`.
- To know the role:
  - Read `userRole` from `localStorage` or from a simple global state.
  - If `userRole === "cp"`, show the `CP Dashboard` link; otherwise do not show it.

4) Access control (simple front-end only)
-----------------------------------------
- In the CP Admin Panel component, add a simple check:
  - If `userRole` in `localStorage` is not `"cp"`, then redirect to `/` (home) or show a message like “Access restricted”.
  - This is only front-end protection for now, which is fine.

5) Do NOT change the visual design
----------------------------------
- Keep the existing styling for the homepage and CP Admin Panel.
- Only add:
  - Routing
  - Role selection in login
  - Role-based navigation + redirect logic.

After implementing, I should be able to:
- Visit `/` and see the homepage.
- Click `Login`, choose "Channel Partner", submit, and automatically land on `/cp-dashboard`.
- Click the logo or `Explore Projects` to go back to `/`.
- See a `CP Dashboard` link in the navbar only when logged in as a CP.
