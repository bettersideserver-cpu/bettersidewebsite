We already have a working Developer Admin Panel with 6 tabs and mock data.
Now we want to add intelligent mock logic so the developer can see REALISTIC CP activity summaries without exposing customer details.

⚠ Do NOT connect to backend, do NOT reveal customer-level lead data.

Update the Developer Dashboard to use mock data representing Channel Partner performance.
We will add a shared mock data structure for all CP activity that contains fields like:

{
  projectName: "Lutyens",
  cpName: "Aman",
  company: "InvestHomes",
  totalLeads: 18,
  hasRunAds: true,
  creativesReceived: 5,
  edmSent: 2
}

Create a mock array with 10–20 sample rows across 2–3 projects (e.g., “Lutyens”, “California State”).

Using this mock dataset, update UI tab logic as follows:

-------------------------
1) Dashboard tab
-------------------------
For each project, calculate and display:
- Number of CPs working on that project
- Number of CPs who have run ads (`hasRunAds === true`)
- Total leads generated per project (`sum totalLeads`)
- Engagement status (use threshold rules below)
Use visual badges or labels for engagement:
- High Activity (sum leads per project > 40)
- Active (20–40)
- Low Activity (< 20)

-------------------------
2) Projects tab
-------------------------
List all projects with summary values from mock data.

When “View Details” is opened for a project, show a table of CPs working on that project with columns:
- CP Name
- Company Name
- Total Leads for this project
- Has run ads (Yes/No)
- Engagement (High / Active / Low)

Engagement rule for each CP:
- > 20 leads = High
- 5–20 leads = Active
- < 5 leads = Low

-------------------------
3) Channel Partners tab
-------------------------
From the same dataset, create a master list of CPs across all projects with:
- CP Name
- Company Name
- City (use mock)
- Number of projects they are attached to
- Total leads across all projects
Sort CPs by total leads descending (most active at the top).

-------------------------
4) Marketing & Ads tab
-------------------------
Instead of random static numbers, compute summary numbers dynamically:

Top cards:
- Creatives provided today (sum creativesReceived for today = mock 0)
- Creatives this month (sum creativesReceived)
- Total creatives (sum creativesReceived)
- Total EDMs sent (sum edmSent)

Table should list entries grouped by project using mock data:
- Date (mock)
- Type (Creative / EDM)
- Project
- Count

-------------------------
5) Performance labels
-------------------------
Any place we show CP or project activity, add visual colored badges:
- High Activity = green
- Active = blue
- Low Activity = orange or gray

-------------------------
Rules
-------------------------
- DO NOT show individual customer/lead details (no phone numbers, names, messages).
- DO NOT modify the CP dashboard.
- DO NOT modify the homepage.
- Only update Developer Dashboard UI logic to use this shared mock dataset.
